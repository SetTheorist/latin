1. in prīncipiō creāvit Deus caelum et terram
2. terra autem erat inānis et vacua et tenebrae super faciem abyssī et spīritus Deī ferēbātur super aquās
3. dīxitque Deus fīat lūx et facta est lūx
4. et vīdit Deus lūcem quod esset bona et dīvīsit lūcem ac tenebrās
5. appellāvitque lūcem diem et tenebrās noctem factumque est vespere et māne diēs ūnus
6. dīxit quoque Deus fīat firmāmentum in mediō aquārum et dīvidat aquās ab aquīs
7. et fēcit Deus firmāmentum dīvīsitque aquās quae erant sub firmāmentō ab hīs quae erant super firmāmentum et factum est ita
8. vocāvitque Deus firmāmentum caelum et factum est vespere et māne diēs secundus

1. In the beginning God created heaven, and earth.
2. And the earth was void and empty, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the spirit of God moved over the waters.
3. And God said: Be light made. And light was made.
4. And God saw the light that it was good; and he divided the light from the darkness.
5. And he called the light Day, and the darkness Night; and there was evening and morning one day.
6. And God said: Let there be a firmament made amidst the waters: and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7. And God made a firmament, and divided the waters that were under the firmament, from those that were above the firmament, and it was so.
8. And God called the firmament, Heaven; and the evening and morning were the second day.
