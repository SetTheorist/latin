1. in prīncipiō creāvit Deus caelum et terram
2. terra autem erat inānis et vacua et tenebrae super faciem abyssī et spīritus Deī ferēbātur super aquās
3. dīxitque Deus fīat lūx et facta est lūx
4. et vīdit Deus lūcem quod esset bona et dīvīsit lūcem ac tenebrās
5. appellāvitque lūcem diem et tenebrās noctem factumque est vespere et māne diēs ūnus
6. dīxit quoque Deus fīat firmāmentum in mediō aquārum et dīvidat aquās ab aquīs
7. et fēcit Deus firmāmentum dīvīsitque aquās quae erant sub firmāmentō ab hīs quae erant super firmāmentum et factum est ita
8. vocāvitque Deus firmāmentum caelum et factum est vespere et māne diēs secundus
9. dīxit vērō Deus congregentur aquae quae sub caelo sunt in locum ūnum et appāreat ārida factumque est ita
10. et vocāvit Deus āridam terram congregātiōnēsque aquārum appellāvit maria et vīdit Deus quod esset bonum
11. et āit germinet terra herbam virentem et facientem sēmen et lignum pōmiferum faciēns frūctum juxta genus suum cujus sēmen in sēmet ipso sit super terram et factum est ita
12. et prōtulit terra herbam virentem et adferentem sēmen juxta genus suum lignumque faciēns frūctum et habēns ūnumquodque sēmentem secundum speciem suam et vīdit Deus quod esset bonum
13. factumque est vespere et māne diēs tertius

1. In the beginning God created heaven, and earth.
2. And the earth was void and empty, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the spirit of God moved over the waters.
3. And God said: Be light made. And light was made.
4. And God saw the light that it was good; and he divided the light from the darkness.
5. And he called the light Day, and the darkness Night; and there was evening and morning one day.
6. And God said: Let there be a firmament made amidst the waters: and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7. And God made a firmament, and divided the waters that were under the firmament, from those that were above the firmament, and it was so.
8. And God called the firmament, Heaven; and the evening and morning were the second day.
9. God also said: Let the waters that are under the heaven, be gathered together into one place: and let the dry land appear. And it was so done.
10. And God called the dry land, Earth; and the gathering together of the waters, he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.
11. And he said: Let the earth bring forth the green herb, and such as may seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind, which may have seed in itself upon the earth. And it was so done.
12. And the earth brought forth the green herb, and such as yieldeth seed according to its kind, and the tree that beareth fruit having seed each one according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
13. And the evening and the morning were the third day.
